This project uses the Naive Bayes Algorithm to detect whether an email is spam or not.
In this exercise, we train the model with set of emails labelled as either from Spam or Not Spam. There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam category. We tested the model on 260 emails and asked the  model to predict the category of this emails and compare the accuracy with correct classification that we already know.
